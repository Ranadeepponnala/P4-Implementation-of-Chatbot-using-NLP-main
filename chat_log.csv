How can I make a budget,"To make a budget, start by tracking your income and expenses. Then, allocate your income towards essential expenses like rent, food, and bills. Next, allocate some of your income towards savings and debt repayment. Finally, allocate the remainder of your income towards discretionary expenses like entertainment and hobbies.",2024-12-24 12:38:18
